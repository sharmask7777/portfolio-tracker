## Mandatory Testing Requirement

For any new functionalities or bug fixes, you MUST mandatorily update and run both hermetic tests (backend/frontend unit tests) and Playwright E2E tests to cover the new code paths. These test updates must be committed as part of the primary change itself.

## Mandatory Data Anonymization & Privacy Protection

- **Zero Real Data Commitment**: You are strictly prohibited from hardcoding, committing, staging, or logging real personal identifying information (PII) or real portfolio data.
- **Forbidden Identifiers**: Absolutely NO real PANs (Permanent Account Numbers), investor names, email addresses, phone numbers, folio numbers, bank/demat details, or actual statement files (CAS PDFs, `parsed_cas.json`, `*.cas.json`).
- **Synthetic Test Data Only**: All tests, fixtures, mocks, and examples MUST use synthetic, fictitious data (e.g. synthetic PANs such as `ABCDE1234F`, `ALPAC1001A`, fictitious user names like "Aarav Sharma", "Neha Patel", etc.).
- **Ignore Verification**: Real CAS statements or parsed JSON files must remain permanently git-ignored and never committed to the repository.

## Mandatory Mock Portfolio Test Suite

- **Comprehensive Mock Suite**: All financial logic, portfolio calculations, consolidation behaviors, and UI views MUST be validated against the 10+ synthetic mock portfolios suite (`backend/src/test/mock-portfolios.spec.ts`, `frontend/src/utils/mock-portfolios.test.ts`, and `frontend/tests/mock-portfolios.spec.ts`).
- **Coverage of Financial Scenarios**: Any new feature or bug fix must ensure the mock portfolio suite covers:
  1. **Scheme Consolidation**: Grouping multiple folios/PANs for the same scheme without duplicate valuation.
  2. **Zero-Holding / Full Redemption Isolation**: Fully redeemed positions must never show active holdings/valuation and must be cleanly isolated in closed positions.
  3. **Partial Redemptions**: FIFO accounting of remaining units, invested cost, and realized gains.
  4. **Stock Intersection & X-Ray**: Accurate underlying company allocation and multi-fund overlap without NaN or phantom exposure.
  5. **Asset-Class Specific States**: Correct behavior for pure debt/liquid (empty equity states) and mixed multi-asset allocations.
  6. **Alternative Assets**: Unlisted assets, SGBs, Physical Gold, and Real Estate integration.
  7. **Multi-Member Profiles**: Family profile switching, aggregation, and cascading deletion integrity.
  8. **Tax Rules & Grandfathering**: Section 112A LTCG grandfathering (Jan 31, 2018 FMV formula) and loss set-off rules.
  9. **Lock-In Restrictions**: ELSS 3-year lock-in and statutory withdrawal constraints.
  10. **Folio Lifecycle**: Manual closing and deletion of folios and managed profiles.
- **Continuous Evolution**: All future use cases, edge cases, and bug fixes MUST be baked into these mock portfolios so regressions are caught permanently.
- **Hook & CI Enforcement**: Mock portfolio tests MUST run as part of hermetic unit tests (`npm test`), the pre-push hook (`.husky/pre-push`), and GitHub Actions workflows (`.github/workflows/e2e.yml`).

## Backend Testing

For any backend changes, both the TypeScript backend test suite (`npm test` in `backend`) and the Rust backend workspace test suite (`cargo test --workspace` in `backend-rs`) must be run and pass.

### Rust Backend Guidelines
- **Zero-I/O `portfolio-core` Invariant**: The `portfolio-core` crate (`crates/portfolio-core`) MUST remain strictly zero-I/O (no databases, no network, no async runtime, no filesystem). All calculations (holdings, FIFO, capital gains tax, performance/XIRR, and X-Ray) must be pure, deterministic functions operating solely in-memory.
- **Fast Hermetic Tests**: Unit tests and property-based tests (`proptest`) in `portfolio-core` must be fast, self-contained, and run hermetically without external dependencies.
- **Parity Verification**: Financial calculations in Rust must maintain numerical parity with the existing TypeScript calculations.

Whenever you write new unit tests in the TypeScript backend, remember to manually import and use `jest.mock('@src/services/db.service', () => require('@src/test/db.mock'))` to avoid attempting real database connections. Run integration tests normally by spinning up the local test docker container!

## Git and Commits

NEVER use `git push --no-verify`. Always run tests locally or allow husky hooks to run properly to prevent spurious changes from being pushed. If tests fail, fix them before pushing.
